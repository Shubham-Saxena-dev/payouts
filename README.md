# Introduction
As a marketplace, we need to pay our sellers for every item that has been sold on our platform. In this task, youâ€™ll be working with 2 main entities: Items to sell (products on the website) and Payouts instructions to send (bank transactions to seller accounts)
API call that accepts a list of sold Items and creates Payouts for the sellers.


# Docker:
This project uses mysql db to store the created payouts
# docker-compose up -d --build

mysql has a connection string to myDb database. Modify it accordingly.
